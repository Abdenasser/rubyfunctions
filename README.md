RUBY FUNCTIONS
==============

Here is the challenge:

1. Write a useful Ruby function
2. Depends only on Ruby core and standard lib

This is a web application to have a community around this idea,
We participate and share these functions to learn from each other
and use it if we need to.

# Why?

1. It would be nice if you're looking for a function that validate URL/Email for example and you get to a website just to get this function, no external libraries needed, just the function use it.
2. Show your creativity using just ruby to deliver something useful, how far can you get with just that?
3. We can learn a lot from each other just by sharing useful functions we write.
4. You get fast feedback on a small snippet of code.
